-Hi. I’m Jay, a 29 years old web developer. I’ve always enjoyed playing with computers since I was little. Not only that, I’m always curious about how software was made. After graduation, I work in the restaurant for many years. I was able to work my way up to the manager position. But there is no more
Promotion opportunity. I decided to go into a different field. Luckily, one day I found a resource about computer science when I was browsing the web. I started to learn about programming, and it became my passion. I love learning new skills and be better with code every single day.

I'm currently learning react. I'll learn angular next.
